  <h2>How to play BINGO</h2>
  <h3>1. Get your dabber.<br>
      2. Get the bingo sheet that the caller tells you to.<br>
    3. Listen and watch carefully.<br>
    4. If - and only if! - the bingo caller calls a number or animal on your sheet, DAB IT with enthusiasm!<br>
    5. If you get 5 in a row, up-and-down or side-to-side or even diagonally, shout BINGO very, very loudly. The first person to get bingo, wins a prize!<br>
    6. The FREE SPACE is a space you can dab right away, and include in your 5-in-a-row.
    7. For this evening, the animal game will stop there. The numbers game will continue for the first blackout bingo.<br>
    Blackout bingo is the first person to dab every square on their board.
